# KRY-projekt

We will send the *loremimsum.txt* to the recepient cyphered by post quantum algorithm. 

```python
python3 kry.py [-c|-d] -a NAME|NUMBER -s NAME|NUMBER filename
```
c cypher
d decypher
a algorithm
s signing

Output of the program is cyphered/decyphered file
filename.cypher

e.g. loremimsum.txt.cypher
